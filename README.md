# inventory-web-app
This Inventory Web App allow users to add new book to the inventory, delete or edit existing book.

Upon loading the page, three books (i.e., resources) can be seen with the required fields. The form is also visible. The page is styled professionally and makes use of CSS Grid.

If the form submitted has empty input, error messages should appear.

When the form is submitted correctly, a new resource is created. In this case, a new book appears on the left side of the screen. The form is then cleared of all values. The "Remove" button will be able to remove this book.

Clicking "In Stock" or "Out of Stock" will toggle the value for that book. Notice how the label is visually distinctive depending on the status of the book.
